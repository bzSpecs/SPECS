# Here RNA pre-processing is performed, cutting away the adapter sequence AACCAGCTCGGATCC
# and isolating the barcode for further processing, 
# output is passed by default to RNA_seq_results/ (hard-coded)

# e.g.
# ./rna_seq_process.sh RNA-seq/HEK293T/HEK293T_2/HEK293T_bio_2_tech_1.fastq HEK293T_b2_t1
